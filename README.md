# KTnSRM
The implementation of Kanai Tajimi model (**KT model**) and the Spectral Representation method (**SRM**).

### Initiate a KT model and simulate realizations with SRM

### Estimate the PSDF or E-PSDF from a realization  

#### 1 PSDF of a stationary realization

#### 2 E- PSDF of a non-stationary realization



###Non-stationary simulation using the estimated EPSDF
