# KTnSRM
The implementation of Kanai Tajimi model (**KT model**) and the Spectral Representation method (**SRM**).

For stochastic structural analyses, KT model is widely used to characterize ground motions as random processes. It has an intuitive physical interpretation for its parameters, i.e. ($\omega_{g}, $\zeta_{g}$, $G_{0}$). Once the model is paramerized, the well known SRM can be used to generate spectrum-compatible simulations. 

Similarly, separable nonstationary spectrum can also be parameterized herein with the addition of time modulating function. In this case, nonstationary simulations can be generated.
